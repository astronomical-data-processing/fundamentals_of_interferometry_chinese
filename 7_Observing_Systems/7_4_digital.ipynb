    "\n",
    "We ended the previous section by discussing the ADC, the analogue component which converts a continuous, analogue signal into a discrete, digitial representation. Once the voltage signal is converted to a digital signal, we can simply record that signal to computer memory, and perform whatever computational operations we desire with software. In the case of interferometric observations, this means computing the correlation between all antenna pairs to produce baseline correlations. Most interferometric arrays produce significant amounts of data, and correlation is a deterministic algorithm. So, instead of recording the digitial signals and then performing the correlations, it is common to build correlators using *digital signal processing* (DSP) modules on custom hardware such as *field programmable gate arrays* (FPGAs), *application specific integrated circuits* (ASICs), and *graphical processing units* (GPUs). Using custom hardware for correlation provides a specialized and power-efficient system, at the cost of limited flexiblity. For arrays with a small number of elements, or for maximum flexibility, software-based correlators can be used. The choice of digital architecture depends on the engineering costs and timescale for an array or facility, but at the core of any correlator system are the same basic DSP operations.\n",

Since this section focuses on aperture synthesis with an interferometric array, we will focus on correlators."

    "Thus, in order to compute a baseline's visibility, the antenna signals are Fourier transformed, the complex conjugate is taken for one of the antenna signals, and it is multiplied with the other antenna signal. A note: the choice of complex conjugation does not make a difference, *as long as it is consistently recorded*, as $V_{pq} = V_{qp}^*$ or - equivalently - $V_{pq}(u,v) = V_{qp}(-u, -v)$. This operation is known as an 'FX' correlation, as the signals are first Fourier transformed (F) and then complex multiplied (X). After multiplication, the resulting signal is averaged over some *integration time length*, since the correlation is a *statistical* operation. This accumulation improves the signal to noise ratio and reduces the instrument's overall data rate. The terms *integration time* and *accumulation length* are often used interchangibly to describe this time scale. There are limits to the maximum integration time, which are set in practice by an image-domain effect known as *smearing* or *decorrelation*. This effect is discussed in ([$\\S$ 2.6.1 &#10142;](../5_Imaging/5_5_widefield_effect.ipynb)). Very short integration times (< 1 second) are used is specific science cases, such as for fast transient events or pulsar imaging where the time scale of the physical process is very short.

When computing the auto-correlation, however, the noise is being correlated with itself - and remains in the correlation. In order to measure the visibility function at the origin, special antennas need to be built in order to mitigate the system noise with additional electronics or by combining interferometric observations with single-dish observations.\n",

    "据历史记载，第一台相关器被称作“滞后相关器lag correlators”，当时还没有使用计算机做快速傅立叶变换，干涉阵列的天线数量不多，观测带宽很窄。相关器给天线增加一系列滞后（lags），然后每个被滞后的信号跟来自参考天线的信号相乘。对每组相关滞后信号积分并保存，然后做傅立叶变换，得到可见度。随着FX相关器的出现，滞后相关器被重新命名为“XF相关器”，因为滞后相关器是先乘（X）后进行傅立叶变换（F）。XF相关器的总体结构见图7.4.2。这种相关器目前已经用的很少，只在少数特殊场合能见到。现代干涉测量阵列，提到相关器的时候，几乎都指的是FX相关器。本节后面的内容也只讨论FX相关器，对滞后相关器感兴趣的读者可以参考 [<cite data-cite='1999ASPC..180.....T'>Chapter 4 of Synthesis Imaging in Radio Astronomy II</cite> &#10548;](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1999ASPC..180.....T)。\n",

    "As a historical note, the first correlator designs were called 'lag correlators'. These correlators pre-date the era of fast Fourier transform implementation using computing hardware, and were built in an era when an array consisted of only a few antennas and the observational bandwidth was fractionally small. This correlation was done by adding a series of time delays (lags) to one antenna, and multiplying the signal from each lag with the signal from a reference antenna. Each correlated lag signal was then integrated for a length of time and subsequently recorded. Later, the recorded correlations at different lags were Fourier transformed to produce the visibility. With the development of FX correlators the lag correlator was renamed the XF correlator as the multiplication (X) we performed before the Fourier tranform (F). Their general architecture is shown in Figure 7.4.2. This type of correlator is rarely used today, except in special cases. For modern interferometric arrays, when correlation is mentioned it is almost always done via FX correlation.

    "The F-engine, a block diagram shown below, is primarily composed of DSP to Fourier-transform the time-domain signal into a frequency-domain spectrum with a fast Fourier transform algorithm. The bandpass of the analogue system and digitisation process select a range of frequencies to be correlated between antennas. The full band from each antenna can be chosen to be correlated against another antenna, but this would only give information about the entire band. If there is strong narrowband RFI, then any correlation will be dominated by that, and the sky signal will be lost. If we are only interested in a weak narrow signal, such as a spectral line, that line structure will be hidden in the band correlation. In order to gain access to subsets of the frequency range, known as *subbands* or *channels*, a Fourier Transform is employed. In this context, a Fourier Transform will transform a wideband time-domain signal into a set of frequency-domain signals (for a given 'window' of samples). As we are working on discrete samples sampled regularly in time, a *Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)* can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "DFT的计算成本可以简单计算为$\\mathcal{O}(N^2)$，即便是较小的$N$值，计算成本也会增长很快，这里$N$为采样（通道）数。针对这一问题的解决方案是采取快速傅立叶变换（Fast Fourier Transform，FFT)，通过规则采样使运算量降低到$\\mathcal{O}(N \\log N)$。“Cooley-Tukey Radix-2 algorithm”是一个经典的FFT算法。值得注意的是，FFT的规模通常为$2^d$，即256, 512, 1024等等，原因在于$2^d$ 可以使得FFT更为高效，其它规模，即便$<2^d$，也会消耗更长的计算时间。\n",
    "\n",
    "The naive computational cost of the DFT is $\\mathcal{O}(N^2)$, which can grow to be very computationally expensive for relatively small sizes of $N$, where $N$ is the number of samples (or channels). The solution to this computational problem is the *Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)* which is a class of algorithms with use the regularity of the sampling to approach a run time of $\\mathcal{O}(N \\log N)$. The *Cooley-Tukey Radix-2 algorithm* is \"the\" classic example of a FFT algorithm. Important note: you will often see FFTs of size $2^d$, i.e. 256, 512, 1024, etc., being used. This is because a size of $2^d$ allows the use of the most efficient FFT. Other FFT sizes, even sizes $<2^d$, will take longer to compute.\n",

    "要点：做FFT的时候，采样数尽量选择为$2^d$。\n",

    "我们继续讨论离散采样时域信号。FFT窗口里的采样数影响到子带的分辨率，对于有$N$个实数值的时域信号，会生成$N/2$个复频率子带。造成2倍信息“损失”的原因在于，FFT变换的输入是实数，输出是复数，因此每个子带有2个值，事实上并没有信息的净损失。窗口采样越多，输出子带的分辨率越高。如果窗口无限宽，则DFT接近于连续傅立叶变换的输出。在另一极端情况下，如果采样窗口为1，则输出跟输入相同。把FFT的输出看成是一系列窄带时域信号，这在DSP领域被称为“滤波器组filterbank”。\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us close this parenthesis and return to our discretely-sampled time-domain signal. Our choice of how many samples to include in the window in which we apply the FFT affects the subband resolution. For $N$ real-valued time-domain signals, $N/2$ complex frequency subbands are created. The apparent factor of 2 'loss' in information due to the FFT is because the output of the FFT is complex and the input is real, so there are effectively 2 values per frequency subband - there is no net information loss. The more samples are included in the window, the higher the resolution of subband outputs. In the extreme case of an infinite window the DFT approaches the continuous Fourier Transform output. On the other exteme, a window of 1 sample will produce the same output as input. It is often useful to think of the FFT generating a series of narrow-band time domain signals: this is called a *filterbank* in DSP.\n",

    "这里一直用术语“窗”来描述FFT的采样区域。从一个连续信号中选择出一段进行采样，事实上，您就已经改变了该信号，因为已经对该信号应用了“礼帽函数（矩形函数）”。虽然没有对采样做任何修改，但是，信号的连续性发生了变化。将FFT作用于窗，从卷积理论的角度来看，就是数据的傅立叶变换与礼帽函数的傅立叶变换进行卷积。礼帽函数的傅立叶变换是一个“辛格sinc函数”，定义为$\\textrm{sinc}(x) = \\frac{\\sin x}{x}$。礼帽函数又被称为“窗函数”，事实上它的性能并不怎么好，主要问题在于旁瓣高和滚降慢。除了礼帽函数，还有许多其它窗函数：Hamming，Hann，Blackman，Gaussian等。这些窗函数考虑了子带宽度、旁瓣水平、旁瓣滚降以及锐度。为什么要使用窗函数进行采样，一个简单的例子，如果子带中存在强RFI，同时窗函数的旁瓣高（如礼帽函数），那么从RFI子带中泄漏出的能量会污染到旁边的子带。\n",

    "I have been using the term windows for blocks of samples which an FFT is applied to. If you take a continuous signal and select out a block of samples, then you have altered the signal: you have effectively applied a *top-hat function* (rectangle) to the signal. This might not seem like an issue since none of the samples have been modified, but the continuity of the signal has been altered. When an FFT is applied to the window, from the convolution theorem, we are convolving the Fourier transform of the data with the Fourier transform of a top-hat function. The Fourier transform of the top-hat function is a *sinc function* which is defined as $\\textrm{sinc}(x) = \\frac{\\sin x}{x}$. The top-hat function is known as a *window function*, and it turns out to be a generally poor one. The primary issue with the top-hat function is that is that there are high 'sidelobes' with a 'slow' roll-off. Many other window functions have been developed: Hamming, Hann, Blackman, Gaussian, etc. These windowing functions have a trade off in the subband width, sidelobe levels, sidelobe roll-off, and sharpness. A simple example as to why you would want to apply a window function to samples is that if there is strong RFI in one subband, and the windowing function has high sidelobes (like a top-hat function), then power will *leak* from the RFI subband to clean neighbour subbands, corrupting it.\n",

    "观测期间，阵列会根据赤经和赤纬$(\\textrm{RA}, \\delta)$进行位置跟踪。该$(\\textrm{RA}, \\delta)$位置为观测的“相位中心”。跟踪是通过“条纹跟踪”或“条纹停止”逻辑实现。利用阵列的天线位置、观测时间以及相位中心，条纹停止逻辑连续不断地更新延迟改正。使用两种类型的延迟：“粗延迟coarse delay”通过整数时间采样延迟输入信号，“细延迟fine delay”通过下级采样进行信号延迟。粗延迟用在傅立叶变换之前，可以看成是增加不同的电缆长度来延迟输入信号。细延迟则是用在傅立叶变换之后，对每个频道进行相位改正。频道不同，相位改正也稍有不同。\n",

    "During an observation, an array will track a position in right ascension and declination $(\\textrm{RA}, \\delta)$ on the sky (typically speaking, anyway; there are special cases such as transiting arrays). This $(\\textrm{RA}, \\delta)$ position is the *phase-centre* of the observation. Tracking is done with *fringe-tracking* or *fringe-stopping* logic. Using the position of the array elements, time of observation, and phase centre, the fringe-stopping logic continuously updates delay corrections. Two types of delays are used: *coarse delay* to delay the incoming signals by integer time samples, and *fine delay* to delay signal by subsamples. The coarse delay is applied before the Fourier transform and can be thought of as physically inserting cables of different lengths to delay the incoming signals. Fine delay is applied after the Fourier transform as a phase correction to each frequnecy channel of the spectra. This phase correction is slightly different for each frequency channel.\n",

    "天线信号以采样频率$f_{\\textrm{samp}}$进行数字化，最大数字频率（奈奎斯特频率）$f_{\\textrm{nyquist}} = \\frac{f_{\\textrm{samp}}}{2}$。采样频率也可以看成是采样时间分辨率$\\Delta t_{\\textrm{samp}} = \\frac{1}{f_{\\textrm{samp}}}$，即天空信号以多大时间间隔进行采样。因此，粗延迟只能按采样率进行信号延迟。例如，如果对250MHz的带宽进行奈奎斯特采样，ADC的采样率为500Msps（mega-sampling per second），则采样时间分辨率为$\\Delta t_{\\textrm{samp}} = 2$纳秒。该时间分辨率也可以看成是物理上的距离分辨率，因为光速为常数$3x10^8$ m/s，则$\\Delta d_{\\textrm{samp}} = \\frac{c}{f_{\\textrm{samp}}}$=60cm。这就意味着，即便我们知道了天线位置且精度高于60cm（天线位置精度通常为毫米量级），延迟也不能被正确校准，从而导致天线间信号的去相关。\n",
    "\n",
    "What occurs with these two different types of delays comes down the fact that the antenna signals have been digitized at some sampling frequency $f_{\\textrm{samp}}$ which results in a maximum digital frequency (i.e. a Nyquist frequency) of $f_{\\textrm{nyquist}} = \\frac{f_{\\textrm{samp}}}{2}$. This sampling frequency can also be thought of a sampling time resolution $\\Delta t_{\\textrm{samp}} = \\frac{1}{f_{\\textrm{samp}}}$: how often the incoming sky signal is sampled. Therefore, coarse delay can only delay a signal at a resolution of the sampling rate. For example, say we want to Nyquist sample 250 MHz of bandwidth. We use an ADC which samples at 500 Msps (mega-sampling per second). In this system, the sampling time resolution is $\\Delta t_{\\textrm{samp}} = 2$ nanoseconds. This time resolution can also be seen as a physical distance resolution, since the speed of light is constant $\\Delta d_{\\textrm{samp}} = \\frac{c}{f_{\\textrm{samp}}}$. Light travels approximately $3 10^8$ metres per second. Conversion to nanoseconds is done by dividing by $10^9$. In our example system, $\\Delta d_{\\textrm{samp}} = 60 cm$. This means that, even if we know the location of the antennas (and hence their delay correction) to better than 60 cm resolution - which is very likely as antenna positions are usually known to millimetre accuracy - the delay cannot be properly corrected, which leads to signal decorrelation between antennas.\n",

Once coarse delay is applied to correct delays up to the $\\Delta t_{\\textrm{samp}}$ resolution, a phase correction $\\phi(\\nu)$ is added to each frequency channel.

Physically pointing telescopes is done to improve sensitivity. Fringe-stopping is required to do aperture synthesis by setting a fixed phase centre for the observation.
